# Superstore-Dataset-Analysis-And-Profit-Prediction
## EDA on superstore dataset and ML model
**About:** The superstore data analysis project aims to gain meaningful insights from a large dataset related to a retail superstore's sales and profit. The dataset contains several attributes, including sales, profit, order date, ship date, and more. By analysing this dataset, the project seeks to uncover patterns, trends, and factors influencing the store's performance to facilitate informed decision-making and drive business growth.
